"Rise Guide was great until part of the process was to purchase SM advertising. At which point I stopped using it.  I had purchased a trail period and they took the yearly subscription without warning. A simple warning to enable people with clear instructions on what happens next and how to cancel would be easy to do and super helpful.I contacted customer services for a full refund which I received promptly, with an apology.  If this review was just for customer services it would be a 5 star review.",Positive

"They put me on a subscription with no notice. During the sign-up process, it looked like a one-off £19.99 fee, but I have just been charged £59.99. There was NO mention of this being a subscription.I'm now talking to customer service, and they say they can't find my account.All the content in the app is clearly written by AI.Don't pay for this app. It's a scam, and just spend some time asking ChatGPT how to make good Instagram posts.

"I believe in people even when they don't believe in not only me, but themselves. So, when we elevate our perspectives and knowledge has attained to understanding our authentic selves, matter, time, waves, ect. We then begin to express our deepest emotions and raw energy to whoever seems to like it or destroy it, by means of ignorance or conflict. But, that's how it is. I don't care. It doesn't matter. We are all apart of the universe. We are all unique. We are members of a vast cosmic orchestra in which every living instrument is essential to the complementary and harmonious playing of the whole.",Neutral
"I purchased a 28-day plan on promotion on the 24th of June. The original price was £59.99, but the promotional price was £19.99, which I paid. This plan clearly ends on the 24th of July.Today, however, you attempted to charge me the full £59.99 — seriously? Thankfully, my bank declined the payment.You will not be getting another penny from me. This feels like a scam, and I’m absolutely done with your service.",Positive

"Be aware! They are big time scammers, they make you do the trial for a small amount, promising they will refund your money if you are not satisfy, but that’s not true! They make it difficult for you to cancel because they don’t even send you the receipt of your subscription, they say only $19 but they will charge $50 every month, and the worse excuse is you subscribed, deceiving in their promise of if you are not satisfy with the product I will return your money, they won’t do it!!! Horrible horrible service, DO NOT FALL FOR THIS!",Negative

Not worth it,Negative

"I was not satisfied with the service or the customer support. I don’t believe they are professional. I requested a refund within the allowed time, and as stated on their website, “if you’re not satisfied, we’ll refund you.” However, this feels like a false promise — in order to receive the refund, I was asked to send my full card number by email, which I find unsafe, especially since they already have all the necessary information to issue the refund. They looked for any excuse to avoid processing it. Terrible service. I gave one star only because zero wasn’t an option.",Negative

To make money online nd get payment after posting video,Neutral
You guys gave me strong tips which I believe will help me,Positive
"UI design is amazing props to the team. The advice is sound and helps users trying to grow. Amazing discussion board as well to connect with other like minded individuals.I didn’t really have time to use most of the features on this app yet, so I apologize if some of the things that i mention were already addressed.There are features that I would like to see implemented:- Connecting Instagram Accounts- Verification to minimize bots- Forum or Reddit like discussion pages- Dark mode- Tracking Instagram stats- Bans on unethical users- Sponsorships- Call center- 1 on 1 coaching- agent managementTake my review with a grain of salt. In reality I am just nitpicking and don’t see any problems. . .yet. For now, I will continue to use the app because I can already tell that this is something that would benefit me in the future.There are many books and ChatGPT does exist. In order to combat the regurgitated information, quality advice should be given by professionals. So far, it seems that everything was written by real, talented individuals. Using robot advice from machine learning would make me change my review in a heartbeat.All in all, the app is great. And it seems that this app was meant for creative minds who want to expand their business.What I Don’t Like:I think that subscription models and paid services are overrated and am waiting to be hit with the content block just like every other app. I mean I can’t blame you people have to make money somehow. Therefore, if I will pay for this service, I would need to get my money’s worth. This app has to be competitive with other apps that are trying to do the same thing. Stand out by selling to the right people, not those who are looking for get rich quick schemes.Growing a brand takes a lot of time and investment, so the right individual/ audience that this app is catered to: must be an ethical person.Ethical in the sense that they are promoting good values that align with their dreams. I despise sellout companies that would give this information to racists and bigots that feed on the hopes and dreams of their audience.Overall, this is just my 2 cents after using this app for 5 minutes.",Positive

"I have been SCAMMED by this company.I was looking at the advert on Instagram - it stated one price.In fact I didn't even click ""buy"" I had auto filled the form, I was looking at their terms and it 'took' the money without my permission. (I did not click ""buy"" and only realised they had taken payment when I checked my bank account.)One price was advertised But they charged more than 10 times the advertised cost. !!!Read the reviews - the positive ones are clear AI generated.Read the negative ones - from people who are angry at the way this company has behaved. It really seems to be a SCAM.- consistently adding unapproved charges- consistently avoiding customer service- consistently refusing to stop recurring charges- consistently avoiding refunds- consistently stating one price then charging another (illegal).On top of that - anyone who has gone on to look at the actual content they provide has been disappointed - it seems there's simply a bunch of AI generated essays with no unique or useful information. - No value!It seems customer services is also AI and the only way to stop them from taking more money is by raising a dispute with your bank.They're generating hundreds of AI reviews to try to combat the truth from getting out.Go look on Reddit the real reviews are the same - people saying this is a SCAM. All trying to work out how to stop damage and stop further payments being taken from their bank account.Cancel the payment from your bank - do not wait for their customer services - it seems apparent that they are only trying to delay you so they can take the next payment from your bank.Avoid!",Positive

"Beware!  They auto-renew without sending you notifications, and you can't easily unsubscribe.  After I got charged, I asked them for a refund, they asked me to fill a form, then refused to refund me, offering me half (I wrote them the day after the charge--- And I noticed another one that I hadn't seen.They have very shady practices.  When I signed up, I thought it was a legitimate course by Andrew Huberman.  It turns out, it is AI bullshit.  I checked the content a bit and never returned back.  Even the initial 60USD was too expensive for this crap.  Then they charged me 160USD for another 6 months of this crap.Now I think I'll have to change my credit card, reading other reviews scares me that they will charge me again even though my subscription is supposed to be canceled!",Negative

"Charged €99,99 without warning – poor communication and misleading refund promise!I was charged €99,99 EUR through PayPal without any prior notice or reminder. I had made what I thought was a one-time payment, and I don’t even remember using the platform—so clearly, it wasn’t useful for my needs at all.When I opened PayPal's Resolution Center, I saw this message from them:""Did you know that it takes 30 days to resolve a dispute and receive your money back here? Contact us at (their support email) to cancel your subscription and/or receive a refund in 1 day, no questions asked. Do not waste your time! We are available 24/7 and will resolve your issue ASAP! Have a wonderful day ahead!""But that’s not what is happening. Their communication has been slow and dragging on. I submitted the form they requested right away, but I’m still waiting for a resolution, as they say they did not receive it!!!I will wait one more day and file a claim on PayPal.As a digital entrepreneur selling courses and memberships as well, all my clients get notifications so that they are aware and make changes to their credit card details or cancel in advance.

Only giving 1 star because I can’t give less. Enquired and looked at a one off item. A few months later I can see they’ve been taking nearly £60 every 4 weeks from my bank because somewhere within an enquiry and buying something I thought was a one off was actually a subscription- absolutely no useful information and hundreds down.Please be careful with this absolute scam of a business.Pay attention to their many 5 star reviews conveniently from people who have only ever reviewed them - not suspicious at all.,Neutral

"Absolutely Fraudulent – Stay Away!This website is a complete scam. I was shocked to discover that they have been charging me $61 every month for the past three months without my knowledge or consent. I never signed up for a subscription — I only intended to access a one-off course, and that’s it.It was only when my bank contacted me about suspicious transactions that I realised what had been happening. I was in total disbelief. There was no clear communication or reminder that I was being charged monthly.Trying to cancel the so-called subscription is a nightmare, and there seems to be no straightforward way to get a refund or even contact proper support. In the end, I had to change my card details just to stop these people from continuing to take money from me.",Neutral

"I downloaded RiseGuide after seeing an ad on Instagram, expecting a normal free app. During registration, I made what I thought was a one-time payment. However, I later discovered that recurring charges had started — without any notification, receipt, or clear confirmation of a subscription.The subscription did not appear in my Apple ID, and I never received any emails or invoices from the app. I couldn’t cancel it through standard means. I only discovered the charges by chance while checking my bank transactions — €19.99 (twice, one minute apart!) and two charges of €59.99. These amounts do not match the official pricing tiers listed in the App Store.When I contacted RiseGuide support, they admitted the terms might have been unclear, but only offered a partial refund, which I declined. After that, they stopped responding.This feels like a classic dark pattern: hidden subscriptions, no communication, automatic billing, and no full refund.I strongly do not recommend this app. If you’ve already been charged, contact your bank to request a chargeback and report the app to Apple",Neutral

"They don’t auto-subscribe you without notice — it literally says in small print that you’ll be auto-subscribed. Most of you just didn’t read before agreeing.

Now offering 50% refund which I've declined. They now say they will fully refund but will take 14 days!!!,Negative
Very straight forward right to the point no run around ⚔️🐺🫡,Positive

"See my original one-star review.I had originally written a review warning people to be careful when they trial RiseGuide as they will automatically renew your subscription without any notification. I paid 9,99 EU to trial them but their renewal was 59,99 EU! Very expensive. It fought for weeks to get a refund.In their response to my Trustpilot review, they said they said they are trying to more transparent, which is promising. However, in their reply, they also said they have issued a refund. What they were NOT transparent about is the fact they only issued me a 50% refund. Again, for a company that wants to be transparent, why not say they're issuing a 50% refund? Because it makes them look better. They know exactly what they're doing but not informing their customers about automatic renewals. Their 97% of customers renew their subscription statistic on their website is proof of that. I'd like to know how many customers remain after the first month!",Positive

"Similar to what others have posted, I have been charged monthly for a service I didn't intend on paying for.  When I tried logging in to the app, it didn't even have my email registered, so there was no way to cancel my subscription!  Judging by the other reviews with similar experiences, I highly recommend people avoid this business and check very closely to what they are agreeing to.  The strategy is to bill you quietly and make it challenging to leave, and it is a poor business practice to trick people into having to pay for things that they just didn't read closely enough.",Neutral

"I purchased a $19.99 product, and Riseguide started helping themselves to $49.99 every month. I missed the first withdrawal, but I noticed the second one. I'm sure they would say that the agreement to subscribe was present in some screen or another, but they do it in such a way that it's easy to miss. This is dishonest. Furthermore, when you go to their website, there is no easy way to just unsubscribe. You have to email them and wait for them to take their own sweet time responding. This is theft by deception.

And.I paid via PayPal and due to not having an invoice as I paid online PayPal can’t  dispute it.I feel totally scammed by this company. I hope anyone thinking about a test of their training products  cancels straight away,The only thing that does work is customer services claiming they will not refund.Note to the person replying to this -  really do you want to work for a company like this ? How would you feel if someone took £59 out of your account and you were not expecting it and you were unable to get it back ? Leaves you feeling bad hey ?

"This is a slimy company. Requested a refund after my account had an unauthorized debit. Held the money in a Friday evening that was pending for a whole week and I couldn't dispute the charge til it was done. This was a 50 dollar lesson and from the looks of other reviews, I had better get a new debit card because it seems as (from reading other reviews) they will continue to debit your account. What a way to run a business. Trash.",Positive
"SCAM! They say they’ll email you when your “trial” period is about to end but there’s not a single email from them, not even for the trial sign up. I received no email confirmations of a subscription plan nor can I view a subscription plan on my account. This makes it rather hard for a consumer to find the associated fees and track subscription costs, and I find this rather deceptive that I cannot view my active subscriptions on my account. Their  prices and subscription costs are not easily viewable on the site and I had to answer a whole questionnaire again to find the pricing. Since you can’t view your subscription on your account, you can’t even cancel it. You have to email them to request cancellation, but they have stated they will offer no refunds for change of mind or not realising the trial period has ended, or not realising subscription costs. So you end up copping a £59.99 fee!",Neutral

"Terrible Experience – Avoid at All CostsThis business is incredibly dishonest and unprofessional. I was charged for services I never agreed to, and when I requested a refund, I was flat-out denied. It feels like their entire model is built on misleading fine print and taking advantage of customers. Communication is poor, accountability is nonexistent, and they clearly have no interest in doing right by the people they serve. Save yourself the frustration — take your money elsewhere. I will be warning as many people as possible to stay away from this company.",Neutral

"How disappointing that I was forced to leave this negative review on a service I had such high hopes for...After accidentally purchasing one of RiseGuide's courses based on a misguiding checkout page (the font of the total price of $19.99 to be paid over the span of 4 weeks was very small, and I purchased the course thinking I was only paying a sixth of what they ended up charging me total $0.72), I promptly emailed them, explained my situation, and requested a refund. Things looked hopeful when they asked me to fill out a short form about the ""experience of their service"", and that my refund process will continue once I completed it (this was on the 20th March). A hop, skip, and a thousand-year jump later, I've received nothing but radio silence from RiseGuide since, and my bank account is still in a $19.99 deficit (it's the 25th of April today).That may not seem like a lot of money to most people, but as a South African who survives day by day in a country with a currency that's so astonishingly weak against the dollar, $19.99 means a lot, and may be the determining factor of whether you're going to bed on am empty stomach or not.It was cruel of RiseGuide to not only falsely advertise their full price by using a clever checkout design (and thereby legally giving them the right to rob people in broad daylight), but then giving me hope as well by telling me they'll be able to offer me a refund in exchange for filling out a form that will benefit them, then running away with both my money and another good review form to add to their name - clearly built on corruption and lies.Perhaps they disappeared because there genuinly was a mix up with my refund request and this is all just a big misunderstanding, but until I can be sure, this review stands:DO NOT PURCHASE ANY COURSES FROM RISEGUIDE - A COMPANY IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR LOWEST RATED REVIEW.I hope this helped someone out there.",Neutral
"This company has taken £19.99 out of my account in March, for something I’ve not signed up to. In April they have taken a further £59.99 out. There has been no email notification about anything I have apparently purchased. And guess what, now they won’t reply to my emails. It’s absolutely disgusting. Stay well clear of this company 😡",Negative
Simple easy to follow steps,Positive
This COMPANY are an ABSOLUTE SCAM STAY WELL CLEAR! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 First they took £19.99 from my card and I Received absolutely nothing and no confirmation of payment. Then they wanted me to buy a book for £20.00 so I came out of it straight away. Then yesterday they tried taking £59.99 out of my debit card but I was a step ahead I cancelled all payments from that card. Thank God. 🙏 Because I knew it was a SCAM! 😡😡😡😡 Disgusting behaviour they need to be taken off the internet.

Be very aware! When you sign up you agree that the plan you choose will automatically be renewed. I paid 9.99 for the 4 week plan and again 59.99 for another 4 weeks. Thats way too expensive. When you agree to terms and conditions there is no info on how to cancel and you cant find cancellation of the renewal in the app so you need to e-mail  RiseGuide. It is a rip off for sure and I do not recommend.,Positive

"Having purchased a 12 week programme in January, for £39, which I found to be full of 'what needs to be done advise' instead of clear 'how to advice', I then got stung for a £99.99 subscription renewal! If I had read through the lengthy T's & C's of the small print, I would have seen this was the practice BUT, the App was not showing as a subscription on my phone, I had NO notification to cancel/subscription was to renew and quite frankly there was a total lack of disclosure that this was in anyway an introduction leading to a year subscription. BEWARE, unethical trading - no surprise that it appears you cannot write comments on their social media page......",Neutral

"I signed up to RiseGuide via an advertisement on Instagram. However before confirming my email address I was already prompted to pay. I decided not to rush (and miss a huge discount) and check out this company beforehand. Going through the reviews I noticed that ALL POSITIVE REVIEWS have been prompted by invitation by Riseguide in the very beginning of the courses. Most are positive because they are still awaiting a lot of useful information from the courses they signed up for. According to me, this disqualifies the value of those reviews. Why not invite all paying customers after finishing the courses?All reviews that are not by invitation rate Riseguide very low! And those are the ones you should read to get a better judgement.For the moment I only signed up as a customer without giving away my payment info. And reading all the problems with unsubscribing, I am glad I did not take any next step. I advise all new subscribers to do the same! Read the uninvited reviews and then unsubscribe!",Positive

"I am really not happy with the way I been charged.I signed up for a 4 WEEK Pan but in very small text its says its a subscription service and not just a 4 week plan, I find this to be very unethical . after the 4 weeks they took another €59.99 from my account with no follow up email.",Negative

"Do NOT get this app. They don't respond to support queries AT ALL and they don't have an unsubscribe function.I immediately upon opening the app for the first time, saw that it was not as advertised on Facebook. It's definitely not crafted with your answers to questions in mind. It's a bunch of small 3 paragraph ""courses"".I asked, within a hour of opening the app and paying for it on Apple Pay, for a refund because it was not what I expected and also for confirmation that the account is closed because you can't unsubscribe!!Since then I sent 4 Support Queries, two to Stacie included in the email and addressed directly. I only got ONE support ticket and STILL NO RESPONSE.It's obviously a scam and in these days a shame on them for doing it.I will continue trying to get a refund and will report it to Facebook where I have a verified account and a Support line.",Neutral
Fácil de usar,Neutral
"I signed up for one month, I got charged for a second month without permission or warning. I emailed asking for a refund which they said they'd give me a free month instead.

I enjoy the self awareness and tips portion.,Positive
Great thanks,Positive

"Never received an account while they had debited the money. The first email I sent about this was only answered with the message that I should look in my spam. When I emailed back that I already indicated this in my first email, I received no response. A week later still no response. After indicating that I wanted my money back and wanted to cancel my subscription, I was told that money could not be refunded 'because I was simply not satisfied for personal reasons'. In addition, they wanted to know if I wanted to continue or if they could help me with something else. While I had already indicated in my previous email that I wanted to cancel. After that again no response. I am going to report them and have my bank take the money back. Looks like a scam!",Neutral

They will offer a 50% refund on a service they never will fulfill. I already cancelled. They charge me anyway, then made me fill out a refund form ? Turns out that was just a customer satisfaction survey not a form to get my money back. They are respectfully full of crap and I would never ever ever in a million years recommend them to ANY creator.

"I signed up for this as a trial. They sent me a welcome email, and that was the last I heard from them. There was zero communication. Six months later, I was automatically billed $159.99 - there was no notice that a payment was coming up, nor that it was time to renew. After contacting them, I initially got a response from them, but no refund was given. They asked me to fill out a form before they could give me a refund. I filled out the 'paperwork' immediately and sent it back. When I contacted them regarding not receiving a refund, I heard nothing back. I have repeatedly reached out to them, and have received no response from any of the correspondence I have sent.**They finally responded and said that, 'I agreed to having automatic withdrawals taken out of my account and therefore they would 'as an exception' give me back half of the yearly subscription amount.' They never addressed the lack of correspondence telling me that they would be taking it out of my account (I belong to a lot of subscriptions - this is the only company that I belong to that doesn't communicate with me ahead of time before taking money out of my account).Unfortunately, I am still NOT impressed with this company and the way they choose to do business. There are so many other more reputable companies.  This one is not worth the headache, and what they offered was not worth the annual fee. Find a different resource!",Neutral

"I subscribed to RiseGuide and discovered there’s no way to unsubscribe through their website, you have to email them. They responded to my first email, confirming that cancellation must be done via email. Since then, I’ve sent 4 follow-up emails to cancel, all of which have been ignored. I was ultimately forced to cancel my card to prevent further charges. The process has been frustrating, time consuming, and feels intentionally misleading. Why isn’t there a simple cancellation option on their site? why did they ignore the emails once i asked to cancel? People should know their requests may be ignored and they risk being charged unfairly. This feels like a scam.",Negative

It’s a scam. You buy the course at £15.99 (or whatever it’s being advertised at on social media) and then they take £59.99 from your account a month later claiming you signed up for a subscription. At no point do they actually tell you it’s a subscription or even how much the subscription is. The content of the course is probably AI generated as it’s obvious stuff you can just google.,Neutral

"They are a scamThey are a scam! Not refunding the amount for your subscription. There is no option to cancel the subscription in their menu or app. When you requested a cancelation, they said okay but kept charging your credit card. All the positive reviews are fake! They are complete scammers. Stay away from those liars!",Neutral
